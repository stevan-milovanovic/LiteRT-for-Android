# Image Classification & Image Captioning with LiteRT


This is a fully functional Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that showcases how to integrate LiteRT for on-device image classification and image captioning. It also demonstrates how to use MediaPipe for on-device large language model (LLM) integration, enabling natural language processing directly on the device.

The project follows modern Android development best practices and serves as a practical reference for developers interested in integrating LiteRT and MediaPipe into their own apps.
